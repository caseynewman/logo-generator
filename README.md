# Logo Generator

## Description

The command line Logo Generator was built so that the user could generate a simple logo by entering their desired criteria in the terminal. A benefit of this application is that the user needs no previous knowledge of design in order to generate a logo that meets their criteria.

In building this project, I learned how to use the inquirer package, fs, and jest. I also gained a better understanding of object-oriented programming and the benefits of using classes. I also learned how to write and run tests for my code. I worked with SVGs for the first time, and practiced using coordinates to position the shapes and text.

## Installation

The user will open the application in their code editor and open the integrated terminal. After running npm install, the user will type 'node index.js' in the command line. They'll then be prompted with criteria questions for their logo.

## Usage

Upon running the code, the user will be prompted with a series of questions about their desired logo. They'll need to enter up to 3 characters for their logo and a color for that text. They'll also be asked what shape they would like their logo to be: a triangle, circle, or square, and what color they would like for that shape. After choosing their criteria, the SVG tag will generate in the logo.svg file. The user can copy the path of that file and run it in their browser, where the logo will appear. The user can save the SVG for personal use.

## Credits

My tutor, John Titus, helped me gain a better understanding of OOP, classes, and their arguments.

## Tests

To run tests for this application, type 'npm run test' into the command line.
